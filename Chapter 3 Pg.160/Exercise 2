Write a Boolean expression that checks whether a given integer is divisible by both 5 and 7, without a
remainder.

namespace NoRemainder
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int check;
            Console.Write("Enter a number to see if it is evenly divisible by both" +
                " 5 and 7 without leaving a remainder: ");
            check = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
            if ((check % 5 == 0) && (check % 7 == 0))
            {
                Console.WriteLine(check + " is divisible by both 5 and 7 without a" +
                    " remainder.");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine(check + " is not divisible by both 5 and 7" +
                    " without a remainder.");
            }
        }
    }
}
