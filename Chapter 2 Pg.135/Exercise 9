Declare two variables of type string and assign them a value “The "use" of quotations causes difficulties.” (without the outer
quotes). In one of the variables use quoted string and in the other do not use it.

namespace QuoteTest
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string quoteOne = The "use" of quotations causes difficulties.;
            string quoteTwo = "The "use" of quotations causes difficulties.";
            string correctQuote = "The use of quotations causes difficulties.";
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}
